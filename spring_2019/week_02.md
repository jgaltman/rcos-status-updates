## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I looked into postgres and installed it on my machine. I configured our django webapp to work with it as well. I checked in with everyone else as well in the group to make sure that we're making progress

## This Week's Plan

Get Postgres on all developers computers
Create mock data and script to load it
Check in on reciever and front end

## Anything Blocking?

Unable to push postgres to git causing developers db's to be out of sync. Looked into heroku to solve this but instead will implement above solution
