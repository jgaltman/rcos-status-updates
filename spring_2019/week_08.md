## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we fixed major nginx issues on the server. The bug was that the static images and css were not loading due to Django's advised debug mode being turned off in production. We were able to fix this by editing the nginx file. We began development on Users and login but that has been slow thanks to authenticating Users are from RPI. I do not expect that the login will be fully finished this semester. We also began beta testing the site this past week. Lastly I helped the hardware team configure the sensor to speed up the timeline towards integration 


## This Week's Plan

This weeks plan is to first and for most create our presentation and prepare for it as a team. Software wise, our plan is continue to test the site and implement a user login. There is a major bug currently where refreshing the page makes it think that someone is occupying a specific room. This week we plan to address this among other bugs as well. The front-end 4th floor should be finished this week as well. Lastly, the automated tests that I've been wanting to get to will finally be developed.

The hardware team will hopefully be ready for testing sometime this week too.


## Anything Blocking?

Time commitments are becoming a problem as the semester is ramping up towards the end. Aside from that debugging weird effects of the website is proving difficult since no one on the team is an expert on web-sciences. For example, the bootstrap navigation bar will not drop down when the window collapses which is a major issue if the majority of users are on mobile devices.
