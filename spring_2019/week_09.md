## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we virtually finished all goals for the semester. We fixed multiple problems on the site including, the timezone error, the dropdown menue bug, and the cache refreshing issue. Additionally we integrated the hardware team with the site. Now the sensor will change a rooms occupancy on the website effectively. Lastly, we created our presentation and presented on Friday.


## This Week's Plan

This weeks plan is to improve documentation and clean our github repo. Additionally we plan to test the site with more scrutiny and detail and hopefully create automated tests with django. Lastly we are going to work on a log in page.


## Anything Blocking?

Automated testing in django is proving difficult to work with.
