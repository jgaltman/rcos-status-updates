## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we researched, tested and developed security for the rasp pi to website communication. We will create a very long string place it on both the rasp pi and the backend and send https request for entering and leaving room with the string and then check it on the server to make sure it came from the correct pi. Additionally we connected the UI to the backend and learned more about django. The room occupancy can be seen on the front end now.

## This Week's Plan

This weeks plan for the group is to create mappings for the floor plan in the UI. We will also get hosting and a domain for our site. Additionally, Automated tests will researched and hopefully begin development on that. The implementation of saving logs for each of the rooms in postgres will be done as well. Lastly, the stats UI page will begin development too.

## Anything Blocking?

Time commitments remain the only thing blocking but the group seems to adjust well regardless.
