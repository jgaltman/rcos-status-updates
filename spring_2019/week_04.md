## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I organized a new schedule so that the group would meet outside of class at least once a week to help with communication and collaboration. This week I, Benji, Jingfei, and Kaijian met up and were able to convert the intial room cache to a floor cache which contains many rooms. We also finally connected the backend where the cache is to the front end for the first time. We set up PostGres on AWS and connected our backend to it as well. Lastly we explored ways of encrypting the http request from the hardware to the server so that only the hardware can adjust the room occupancy setting and not a malicious RPI student. 

## This Week's Plan

This weeks plan is spring break. The week after that we will be focusing on developing the front end further and implementing the room statistics part of the back end. We may also potentially try to port our app to a server on AWS as well. We will also continue to research additional parts of the project such as securing the hardware communication, testing the website functionality, and mobile accessability. 

## Anything Blocking?

Now that our communication has been fixed, time commitments are the only thing blocking people but the team has been able to work successfully despite that.
