## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we acheived major breakthroughs in the project. Officially we are displaying a room being occupied/unoccupied. Additionally, logging the room changes has been implemented. I also added a stats UI page of each rooms logs and activity was added too. The database tables have been created and are integrated with the app now too.

## This Week's Plan

This weeks plan is to improve upon the UI by adding the additional rooms in the library and  enabling multiple screen size viewing. We also will add a simple about page to the website too. Additionally, we are going to get hosting and a domain for the site. Lastly we plan to add automated tests to the website as well as manual tests with a raspberry pi. We still need to test https requests to make sure that the security is right and we need to integrate with the hardware team in the near future.

## Anything Blocking?

One of our members met with the CIO of the library and Pub Safe this past week and they had concerns with our webapp. They are worried that a potential active shooter could use our webapp to find people in the library. This may be a major issue for our project and we are working to resolve this. Potentially by adding log in capabilities and discussing other fixes with Pubsafe, the CIO in the near futurue and discussing fixes with RCOS during our next small session.
