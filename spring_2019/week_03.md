## Last Week's Accomplishments

Configured Postgres and wrote script to populate sample data. Began to creatre room and floor models.

## This Week's Plan

This past week's work has all been in vain. The group wants to migrate to AWS. We will migrate it all to AWS. I will get the Room and floor models built.

## Anything Blocking?

Communication has been an issue. Recently started a new groupchat though, so hopefully it improves.
